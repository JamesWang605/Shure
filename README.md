## My Experience

I visited Shure factory on Dec. 25, 2018. I saw the production process and listened some earbuds products of Shure. surprisingly, most of the Assembly parts including welding and packaging are all done by workers instead of machines. I was surprised that these repeated acting are not finished by machine, I thought that hiring workers are much more expensive than the cost of designing and building machines for earbuds assembly.
